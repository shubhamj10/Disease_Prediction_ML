# Disease-Prediction-Using-ML

This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict diseases based on user-provided symptom descriptions. It features two distinct models: one for symptom extraction and another for disease prediction, ensuring high accuracy in results.

This is a React.js project 

## Features

- **Symptom Extraction Model**: Efficiently identifies and extracts symptoms from user input.
- **Disease Prediction Model**: Predicts potential diseases based on the extracted symptoms.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves reliable results through advanced machine learning techniques.


## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS.
- **AI Services**:
  - Conversation: [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com).
 
- **Version Control**: Managed with Git and GitHub.
